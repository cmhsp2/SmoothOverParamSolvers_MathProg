Many of our experiments make use of LBFGS. We used the implementation of Stephen Becker (https://github.com/stephenbeckr/L-BFGS-B-C)


ISTA_comparison: several files for numerically investigating the conditioning of VarPro and also comparisons against ISTA and mirror descent.

Nonconvex: experiments for comparison against IRLS and reweighted l1 for l_q minimisation problems (with quadratic loss or linear constraint)

overlappingGroup: experiments for overlapping group lasso. Comparisons against ADMM.

SqrtLasso: experiments for square root lasso. Comparisons against coordinate descent.

TV_example: experiments for TV regularisation. Comparisons against ADMM and Primal dual.
